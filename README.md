# 49 Ride Challenge

The 49 Ride Challenge App is a companion app to be used during the challenge.
Currently there is no way to track what rides you have been on and what rides you still need without
printing out a list and doing it the old fashioned way. With this application you will be able to view
all the rides you have been on, see what rides are left and keep track of your time per attempt. Once a
challenge attempt is completed your time and ride total will be stored and ranked in your Scores.
